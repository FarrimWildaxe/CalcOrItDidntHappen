# Calc Or It Didn't Happen
A curated collection of Living off the Land (LotL) attack demonstrations where trusted binaries go rogue, because if it didn’t launch calc.exe, did it even happen?

This repo showcases practical PoCs using LOLBAS techniques to execute commands without dropping malware. Whether you're a red teamer, researcher, or just here for the chaos, you’ll find "weaponized" LOL moments and harmless-looking binaries doing suspiciously powerful things or not.

💻 Built for demos.

🎩 Powered by misused trust.
